## Goals ðŸ¥…
By the end of the semester, I hope to make a **comprehensive final project**, building a multi-feature application that showcases data visualization, processing, and machine learning to solve a real-world challenge. To achieve this goal, I first must:
- **OOP:** Refine my knowedlege of object-oriented programming.
- **data visualization and storytelling:**  transitioning from static charts to interactive dashboards using Streamlit. I want to learn how to present data effectively through filtering, sorting, and narrative techniques.  

-  **data wrangling and preprocessing:** cleaning, transforming, and validating datasets, handling missing values, reshaping tables, and working with time-series data to prepare for analysis and modeling.  

- **data structures and databases:** working with stacks, queues, and hash tables while gaining hands-on experience with SQLite and ETL processes to integrate databases into applications.  

- **text and image processing:** using NLP tools like NLTK and SpaCy for sentiment analysis and text processing, along with OpenCV and Pillow for image-related tasks.  
- **foundational machine learning concepts:** training models using scikit-learn, and integrating them into interactive applications while considering ethical implications.
